# LatinAmericanIsolates
Data Files used in analyses for Understanding the Hidden Complexity of Latin American Population Isolates

There is a single file with all the counts used:
  Results_SeatSeq_results_JzWholeGenome_v4_Aug17_AllSeqIndivs_Final
    counts of NS, SYN, putatively neutral, and putatively deleterious sites annotated using SeattleSeq for each individual.
    column names correspond to the type of counting method for each variant annotation


There are two files containing ROH:
  TrueROH_AllSeqIndivs_perIndivFINAL_Aug17.txt 
        Runs of homozygosity in N=449 sequenced individuals that remained after QC of data
  TrueROH_Unrelated_perIndivFINAL_Aug17.txt
        Runs of homozygosity in N=30 (per population) individuals that remained after QC of data

There are nine files containing IBD segments:
  IBD segments have extension: _allchroms_IBDSeq_FormattedRscript.out
    Each file is split by population and contains the IBD segments output IBDSeq and used as input for IBDNe.
